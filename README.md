# Correlation Analysis in Python

This project explores correlations between numerical variables in a dataset using Python. The goal was to identify how strongly different features relate to one another and visualize the relationships with heatmaps and regression plots.

## Project Overview

Using the `.corr()` method and Seaborn heatmaps, I looked for patterns and insights in the dataset. This helped in understanding which variables were most related and could influence future predictions or decisions.

## Whatâ€™s Included
- Correlation matrix using `.corr()`
- Visual heatmap for easier interpretation
- Scatter plots with regression lines
- Filtering and sorting based on correlation strength

## Key Goals
- Practice basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understand relationships between numerical columns
- Visualize trends with scatter plots and heatmaps

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook


## Note
This was an early-stage EDA project focused on strengthening my understanding of how to read and interpret correlations in real data.
